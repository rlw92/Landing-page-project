        <p>I ordered from Bex Bakery on a saturday night  for a batch of cupcakes for my mother's birthday which was 
            the next day. 
            They were delivered on time, fresh in the box and were some of the best cupcakes I had ever eaten, 
            it was a miracle
             I didn't eat all of them before giving them to my mother.  - Kenny, Abertillery
