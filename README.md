# Landing-page-project
The repo for the landing page project on Odin project.

This project should be built using the flexbox layout method.

Everything should look similiar to the design1 image in the repository.

I am hoping to base the content on my fiance's bakery.

This website project was part of the css foundations section of The Odin project.

I built the website from the design provided in the design1 image in the repository.

I have based the content on my fiance's prospective bakery. 

I found the images on pexels.com.

I am pleased with the results but the site is not yet responsive which I will hopefully
be learning next.
